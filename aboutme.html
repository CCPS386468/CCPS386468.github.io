    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> Overall, in my personal life I am working towards being a better person, I'm try to be there for everyone and enjoy life at the moment in order to achieve this. My professional goal is to not have a job that is sitting at a desk all day in an office, in order to achieve this I want to  go to a 4 year college and then go to med school to become a RN and then maybe go to school after few years again to be able to become a NP or CRNA. I would like to be able work in the NICU as I was born 10 weeks early and because of the workers in that department I am still living. I am working towards these goals by taking honors biology and signing up to take AP biology next year. I am also taking a biomedical class to expose me to biology applied in a medical form. Some of the values I have that are necessary for my success would be to be optimistic for my future as I am hopeful that confident that I will be able to achieve these goals. Another value would be kindness as it is how I will be able to be a better person. One of the short term goals I have is finishing this school year with a 4.0 GPA , and being able to AP classes next school year. The character traits I hope to be known as is kindness and hardworking as both make up what I want to be as a person. I want to have many achievements that I am known like graduating college and med school. I also would like to be able to by land out of Florida and build a house on it.</p>
